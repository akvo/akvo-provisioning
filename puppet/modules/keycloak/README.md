reporter
========

Sets up a Keycloak server with PostgreSQL database


## Prerequisites
The Reportserver distribution archive must be available at http://files.support.akvo-ops.org/keycloak/ 

## Bootstrapping
 Several packages require libssl, which needs a postinstall reboot, so the server will probably need to be rebooted before working properly.
You will see a *** System restart required *** message when logging into the server. Believe it.



## Todo
